# CSC_43M04_EP - Modal d'informatique - Deep Learning in Computer Vision (2024-2025)

## General Information

This course will introduce the fundamental concepts behing deep learning with a particular focus on computer vision. We will start by the different optimizations techniques that will be used and by classical computer vision techniques and then introduce neural networks. Topics covered in this course will include:

Optimization techniques: gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and enhancements (Nesterov momentum, Adam, NADAM)
Neural Networks: training, validation, testing, back propagation, activation and loss functions, universal approximation theorem, data augmentation, ResNets, batch normalization, weight sharing
ConvNets: LeNet, Pooling, AlexNet, ...
Image classification architectures: ImageNet, AlexNet, VGG, InceptionNet, pre-training and progressive training
Attention and Transformers
Object Detection Architectures: Region-proposal networks, RCNN, feature pyramids, SPPnet
Generative and Adversarial Networks: auto-encoders, GANs, variational GANs
Neural Network debugging and analysis: network visualisation, neural tranfer, using intermediate layers as features
Video recognition: video understanding, classification, localization 

## Additional Information

- The folder `GenAI` contains supplementary code done by myself beyond the course program.
